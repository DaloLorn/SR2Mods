	Name: Dalo's Flag Extension
	Description: <<
		Adds 16 flags from various science fiction:[list]
		[*]Stargate:[list]
		[*]Anubis' symbol (scale is wrong, nothing I can do about it)
		[*]Apophis' symbol (scale may be wrong too - the game only takes square images and resizes others accordingly)
		[*]Earth point of origin (Tau'ri symbol)
		[/list]
		[*]Star Trek:[list]
		[*]Klingon Empire (minor rescaling)
		[*]Romulan Star Empire (minor rescaling, I think)
		[*]United Federation of Planets (minor rescaling, I think)
		[/list]
		[*]Star Wars:[list]
		[*]Galactic Empire
		[*]Rebel Alliance (minor rescaling, I think)
		[/list]
		[*]Homeworld (No, I do not have the games. No, I cannot port its shipsets without the proper assets. A friend of mine linked to the image when we were coming up with ideas for this mod, and I went with it.):[list]
		[*]Hiigarans
		[/list]
		[*]StarCraft:[list]
		[*]Daelaam - Daelaam Regalia
		[*]Terran Dominion
		[*]Nerazim - Shelak Tribe
		[*]Protoss Protectorate - Adept
		[*]Sons of Korhal
		[*]Dominion Marine Corps (and here I thought it had something to do with Raynor's Raiders...) - Marshall
		[*]Tal'Darim - Tal'Darim Standard
		[/list]
		[/list]


		DISCLAIMER: I did not make any of the source images. I took them from StarCraft 2 and the Stargate, Star Wars, Star Trek and Homeworld wikis and edited as needed.

		Namespaces occupied (mostly here to help other modders avoid conflicts): ANUBIS, APOPHIS, DAELAAM, EMPIRE, HIIGARA, KDF, NERAZIM, PROTOSS, REBEL, RSE, SONS_KORHAL, STARCRAFT_DOMINION, STARCRAFT_MARINES, TALDARIM, TAURI, UFP.
