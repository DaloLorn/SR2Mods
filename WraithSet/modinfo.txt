	Name: Wraith Alliance
	Description: <<
		A Wraith shipset ported from Star Wars: Empire at War. Does not yet have any default designs. More hulls may come at a later date along with better textures. (I really, REALLY hope they do - the hive is passable, but the cruiser's abysmal. Not to mention the fact that the cruiser's engines are in the wrong place...)

		Models and textures originally made for the Stargate ship pack for Star Trek: Bridge Commander: http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/Stargate_Ship_Pack;65246

		Assets converted again from Stargate: Empire at War assets (who modified the Bridge Commander assets for SGEaW, I'm not sure - but it was the SGEaW team) for use in SR2 by Stargate Modding Group (AKA the SGEaW team :P) member 'Imperial' and Dalo Lorn. (Mostly Imperial, really - all I did was rescale and rotate the models and write up the shipset code.)

		If I miscredited anyone, let me know.
