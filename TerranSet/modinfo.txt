		[b][i][u]NOTE[/u]: It is absolutely vital that you download the 'DOF-Shipset-Common Library' addon from here: [url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505348416[/url]. Failure to do so will have unpredictable effects, the least of which will invariably be that all hulls will be untextured black blobs - worst-case scenario, the game may cease functioning altogether![/i][/b] 

		A Terran shipset from StarCraft 2. This one doesn't include subsets like the Protoss one. Does not have any default designs.

		Credits:
		- Blizzard Entertainment for all models and textures except where stated otherwise

		- SC2Mapster community for Valkyrie model and textures, and Behemoth- and Explorer-class models.

		- Yours truly for converting all of this stuff from .m3 and .dds files into the .obj and .png files SR2 knows how to interpret

		- Thy Reaper for helping me resolve texturing issues. Without his guidance, this would not exist. Of course, the entire Blind Mind team should be in these credits just for making the game! :)


		If I miscredited someone, or there's a bug, don't hesitate to point it out.
