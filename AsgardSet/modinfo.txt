	Name: Asgard Empire
	Description: <<
		An Asgard shipset ported from Star Wars: Empire at War. Does not yet have any default designs. More hulls may come at a later date along with better textures.
		
		Models and textures originally made for the Stargate ship pack for Star Trek: Bridge Commander: http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/Stargate_Ship_Pack;65246
		
		Assets converted again from Stargate: Empire at War assets (who modified the Bridge Commander assets for SGEaW, I'm not sure - but it was the SGEaW team) for use in SR2 by Stargate Modding Group (AKA the SGEaW team :P) member 'Imperial' and Dalo Lorn. (Mostly Imperial, really - all I did was rescale and rotate the models and write up the shipset code.)

		If I miscredited anyone, let me know.
