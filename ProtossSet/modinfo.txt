		[b][i][u]NOTE[/u]: It is absolutely vital that you download the 'DOF-Shipset-Common Library' addon from here: [url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505348416[/url]. Failure to do so will have unpredictable effects, the least of which will invariably be that all hulls will be untextured black blobs - worst-case scenario, the game may cease functioning altogether![/i][/b] 

		A Protoss shipset ported from StarCraft 2. Includes subsets - variants of the shipset which have had some ships thematically stripped out, subsets are intended for use by the AI; though they can quite easily be used by players. Does not have any default designs. Includes custom hex limits through use of the Hex Limit Modifier.

		Subsets:
		- Nerazim: Dark Templar, only contains Dark Templar units. Fairly decently-sized.
		- Tal'darim: 'Dark Protoss' models were used in Heart of the Swarm to represent the Tal'darim. Second smallest subset, but still fairly large. Now also includes several 'Death Fleet' units from the Legacy of the Void Tal'darim.
		- Khalai: 'Light Protoss' models, but no Dark Templar units. Smaller only than the Daelaam subset.
		- Daelaam: The Aiur and Nerazim subsets combined; in other words, StarCraft 2 units.
		- Purifier: Purifiers as seen in Legacy of the Void. Smaller even than the Nerazim.
