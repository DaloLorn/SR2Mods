# SR2Mods
All the various Star Ruler 2 mods I've published on the Workshop.

Use the OpenSR Launchpad to install mods from the All-Mods branch. Ignore all other branches.

# NOTE: If a commit containing "#STEAM" in it exists, you must clone or download THAT commit. Cloning/downloading commits before or after that one will mean that your version of the mod(s) will not be compatible with the Workshop version.
