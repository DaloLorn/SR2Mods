	Name: Unity of the Advent
	Description: <<
		[b][i][u]NOTE[/u]: It is absolutely vital that you download the 'DOF-Shipset-Common Library' addon from here: [url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505348416[/url]. Failure to do so will have unpredictable effects, the least of which will invariably be that all hulls will be untextured black blobs - worst-case scenario, the game may cease functioning altogether![/i][/b]

		[i]Long-banished deviants, now calling themselves the Advent, came back more powerful and twisted than we could have imagined. Many undefended worlds fell to their corruption before we could redirect forces from the alien front.[/i]

		An Advent shipset ported from Sins of a Solar Empire. Does not have any default designs. Includes custom hex limits through use of the Hex Limit Modifier.

		Credits:

		- Original shipset's (1.0) models and textures sourced from Space Empires 5 shipset by Prometeu of spaceempires.net. (Said shipset is no longer available for download.)
		- Additional models for 2.0 retrieved from Myfist's stash on OneDrive. (No idea where the 'Myfist' in question is active, presumably one of the SoaSE modding forums. :P)
		- All textures in 2.0 and 2.1, including upgrades for 1.0 assets, retrieved directly from SoaSE: Rebellion assets by Ironclad Games. (The models themselves are also Rebellion assets - it's just that I don't have the professional tools required to convert them directly so I have to rely on what I can scrounge up from other sources.)
		- Additional models for 2.1 converted by dolynick.
		- Asset conversion (model rescaling and rotating, all the texture work) and shipset assembly done by me.
