	Name: Unity of the Advent
	Description: <<
		An Advent shipset ported from Space Empires 5. All graphics originally ported from Ironclad Games' Sins of a Solar Empire by Prometeu from spaceempires.net. (Prometeu's shipset pack has since been taken down by its author, as he announced the day he uploaded it.)

		Does not have any default designs of its own; the game loads new designs from other shipsets. I would have included a few, but they would be incompatible with the Hex Limit Reverter, so... sorry. I'll upload to the Community instead.

		Has customized hex limits for most of its hulls. Compatible with the Hex Limit Reverter.
